# GO APP
I created a TCP Server using Elixir and an iOS GUI interface
The idea of the app is that the user is able to let people know if he or she is going out that night. That's why it is called GO (Going Out)

# Testing Elixir Server 
1) Go into the go directory and run the command $ iex -S mix
2) Open a new tab on terminal and run $ telnet 127.0.0.1 4000
3) Simply type in your name and you should get a "going out!" response

# Running iOS
1) Go into the GO-iOS directory and run the command $pod install
2) Open up xcode workspace and run the project
3) Type in your name on the textfield and hit the "Going Out" Button
4) You should recieve a succes and message in the console
